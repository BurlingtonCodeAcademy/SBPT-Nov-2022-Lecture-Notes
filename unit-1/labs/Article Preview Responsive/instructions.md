# Objective

## Learning

In this lab, we will utilize the previous Article Preview lab to practice utilizing media queries to create a mobile responsive layout.

Topics:

- Utilizing a given wire frame.
- Media queries
- CSS flexbox layout.
- Responsive CSS units of measurement & responsive design.

## Achieving

In this lab, we will utilize a given wire frame to further our previous layout in Article Preview. When viewed on a smaller screen, we want our layout to match the mobile layout on the wire frame.

Your work will result in:

- A website that closely matches the desktop and mobile designs in the given wireframe.

# Procedure

## Opening and referencing the wireframe

- [ ] Click the following link to open the wire frame: [Figma Wire Frame](https://www.figma.com/file/TPiWJvpu5M0xDM8lxAwjVC/article-preview-responsive?node-id=0%3A1).
- [ ] **Note:** This wireframe is not "pixel perfect" so don't stress having it match dimensions exactly. We are looking to capture the spirit of the wireframe.
- [ ] This wireframe maps to semantic divs you need to create. See if you can understand the wireframe without referencing the explicit instructions in the previous labs. 

## Styling the divs

- [ ] CSS selectors and CSS properties will again be utilized.
- [ ] Responsive units of measurement will need to be utilized: `rem`, `em`, `vw`, `vh`, `%`s.
- [ ] You will need to utilize the CSS flexbox layout model in order to achieve the wireframe.
- [ ] You will need to utilize CSS media queries for the mobile layout.
- [ ] As a reminder, here are a few options for placeholder images: [Lorem Flickr](https://loremflickr.com/), [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/). [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

# Review

In this lab, we have translated a wireframe to a website utilizing CSS. We have used media queries to create a mobile version of our layout.

The software should:

- Be a styled website whose design matches the given wireframe on the desktop version and the mobile version.

## Going Further

- Customize the colors on the website.
- Import fonts and utilize them.
- If you did not complete the bonus "Support" wireframe in Article Preview, complete that on this new project.
- If you did complete the bonus "Support" wireframe, play with adding media queries to its CSS so it is mobile responsive as well.
