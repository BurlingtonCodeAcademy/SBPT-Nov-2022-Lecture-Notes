# Grid & Flex Code-Along

## Welcome!

The purpose of this repo is to code along with the lecture in class. To maximize our time, a good portion of the page has been framed and styled out minus any of the **Grid** or **Flex** aspects of the page. We'll be doing that together!

Here is a quick look at what we are going to create:

## What This Is:
This is meant to capture notes and see some of the capabilities that both of these display properties have to offer. 

Its a place to engage with some HTML and CSS. Notes will be injected both into the HTML and as comments within both documents.

In addition, there are couple resources already built into the HTML for you to explore on your own.

## What This Is Not:
This isn't meant to be pretty. We can leave you up to the task to build more into this page as you start gaining more tools in your toolbox. 

This isn't meant to cover everything that these two display properties have available to them.

## NOTE!
As mentioned prior, there is a portion of this project already styled out. **DO NOT** alter this code during the lesson. Feel free to update or play around with it afterwards at your own risk. The ```main.css``` is targeting the same elements that will be updating in ```gridAndFlex.css``` but for different reasons. These were separated so as to not add to any confusion and keep the focus on the ```display``` properties.
